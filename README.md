The Mano Machine, conceptualized by M. Morris Mano in the textbook Computer System Architecture (3rd ed.), is a theoretical computer that serves as an excellent educational tool for understanding the workings of a microcontroller. This project aims to emulate the Mano Machine in the web and provide an assembler and GUI for programming it, along with comprehensive web documentation that aims to be engaging through interactivity.
