# Digital Logic Gates

In digital computers, binary information is represented by physical quantities known as signals. These signals, typically in the form of electrical voltages, can exist in one of two states, corresponding to the binary values 0 and 1. For instance, a digital computer might use a voltage of 3 volts to represent binary 1 and 0.5 volts to represent binary 0. The input terminals of digital circuits receive these binary signals, and the circuits respond with output signals of 3 and 0.5 volts to represent binary 1 and 0, respectively.

Binary logic is the foundation of digital circuit design, dealing with binary variables and logical operations. These operations are performed by logic circuits known as gates. Gates are hardware components that produce binary outputs based on specific input conditions. Each type of gate has a unique graphical symbol and can be described algebraically. The relationship between inputs and outputs for each gate can be represented using a truth table.

Below is a detailed explanation of eight fundamental types of logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, Inverter, Buffer, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.

## AND Gate

### Description

The AND gate performs a logical conjunction operation. It produces an output of 1 only if all its inputs are 1. If any input is 0, the output is 0.

### Symbol

### Algebraic Function

$ x = A \cdot B $

### Truth Table

| A   | B   | x   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

### Characteristics

- AND gates can have more than two inputs.
- The output is 1 if and only if all inputs are 1.

## OR Gate

### Description

The OR gate performs a logical disjunction operation. It produces an output of 1 if any of its inputs are 1. The output is 0 only when all inputs are 0.

### Symbol

### Algebraic Function

$ x = A + B $

### Truth Table

| A   | B   | x   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |

| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

### Characteristics

- OR gates can have more than two inputs.
- The output is 1 if any input is 1.

## NOT Gate

### Description

The NOT gate, also known as an inverter, performs a logical negation operation. It inverts the input signal; if the input is 1, the output is 0, and vice versa.

### Symbol

### Algebraic Function

$ x = \overline A $

### Truth Table

| A   | x   |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   |

# Characteristics

- The NOT gate has only one input and one output.
- It is used to complement binary signals.

## Buffer

### Description

A buffer is a logic gate that outputs the same value as its input. It does not perform any logical operation but is used for signal amplification and isolation.

### Symbol

### Algebraic Function

$ x = A $

### Truth Table

| A   | x   |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   |

### Characteristics

- Buffers are used to strengthen signals so they can drive more gates.
- They provide no logical transformation of the input signal.

## NAND Gate

The NAND gate is the complement of the AND gate. It produces an output of 0 only if all its inputs are 1. If any input is 0, the output is 1.

### Symbol

- NAND gates can have more than two inputs.
- The output is the complement of the AND function.

## NOR Gate

### Description

The NOR gate is the complement of the OR gate. It produces an output of 0 if any of its inputs are 1. The output is 1 only when all inputs are 0.

## XOR Gate

### Description

The XOR (exclusive-OR) gate produces an output of 1 if the inputs are different. If both inputs are the same, the output is 0.

### Symbol

### Truth Table

| A   | B   | x   |

- It is also known as an odd function gate.

## XNOR Gate
