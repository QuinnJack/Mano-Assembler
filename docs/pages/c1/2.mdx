# Digital Logic Gates

In digital computers, binary information is represented by physical quantities known as signals. These signals, typically in the form of electrical voltages, can exist in one of two states, corresponding to the binary values 0 and 1. For instance, a digital computer might use a voltage of 3 volts to represent binary 1 and 0.5 volts to represent binary 0. The input terminals of digital circuits receive these binary signals, and the circuits respond with output signals of 3 and 0.5 volts to represent binary 1 and 0, respectively.

Binary logic is the foundation of digital circuit design, dealing with binary variables and logical operations. These operations are performed by logic circuits known as gates. Gates are hardware components that produce binary outputs based on specific input conditions. Each type of gate has a unique graphical symbol and can be described algebraically. The relationship between inputs and outputs for each gate can be represented using a truth table.

## Constructing Truth Tables

Truth tables are essential tools for understanding and analyzing digital logic circuits. They provide a comprehensive view of all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs. Here's how to construct a truth table:

1. Identify all input variables.
2. Determine the number of rows needed (2^n, where n is the number of input variables).
3. List all possible input combinations.
4. Evaluate the output for each input combination.
5. Fill in the output column(s).

### Example: Constructing a Truth Table for A · B + C

Let's construct a truth table for the expression A · B + C:

1. Inputs: A, B, and C
2. Number of rows: 2^3 = 8
3. List input combinations:

| A   | B   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

4. Evaluate the output for each row:

   - First, evaluate A · B
   - Then, add the result to C

5. Fill in the output column:

| A   | B   | C   | A · B | (A · B) + C |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | ----------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0     | 0           |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0     | 1           |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0     | 0           |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0     | 1           |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0     | 0           |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0     | 1           |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1     | 1           |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1     | 1           |

This truth table now completely describes the behavior of the circuit for all possible input combinations.

## More Complex Circuits

When dealing with more complex circuits, it's important to break them down into smaller, manageable parts. Here's a step-by-step approach to analyze these circuits:

1. Identify the gates and their connections.
2. Label intermediate outputs.
3. Evaluate the circuit stage by stage.
4. Combine the results to get the final output.

### Example: Analyzing a Complex Circuit

Consider the following circuit:

```
   A ---[AND]--+
               |
   B ---[AND]--+--[OR]--- X
               |
   C ---[NOT]--+
```

To analyze this circuit:

1. Identify gates: Two AND gates, one OR gate, and one NOT gate.
2. Label intermediate outputs:
   - Y1 = A · B (output of first AND gate)
   - Y2 = ¬C (output of NOT gate)
3. Evaluate stage by stage:
   - X = Y1 + Y2
4. Combine results:
   - X = (A · B) + ¬C

Now we can construct the truth table:

| A   | B   | C   | Y1 (A · B) | Y2 (¬C) | X ((A · B) + ¬C) |
| --- | --- | --- | ---------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0          | 1       | 1                |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0          | 0       | 0                |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0          | 1       | 1                |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0          | 0       | 0                |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0          | 1       | 1                |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0          | 0       | 0                |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1          | 1       | 1                |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1          | 0       | 1                |

This approach allows us to break down complex circuits into manageable parts and understand their overall behavior.

## NAND Completeness

NAND gates have a special property known as functional completeness. This means that any Boolean function can be implemented using only NAND gates. This property makes the NAND gate a universal gate in digital logic design.

### Implementing Basic Gates with NAND

1. NOT Gate:

   - A NAND gate with both inputs connected together acts as a NOT gate.

   ```
   A ---[NAND]--- ¬A
   |
   +---+
   ```

2. AND Gate:

   - An AND gate can be created by inverting the output of a NAND gate.

   ```
   A ---[NAND]---[NAND]--- A · B
   B ---+
   ```

3. OR Gate:

   - Using De Morgan's laws, we can create an OR gate with NAND gates.

   ```
   A ---[NAND]---+
                 |
   B ---[NAND]---+---[NAND]--- A + B
   ```

4. NOR Gate:
   - A NOR gate can be implemented using NAND gates as follows:
   ```
   A ---[NAND]---+
                 |
   B ---[NAND]---+---[NAND]---[NAND]--- ¬(A + B)
   ```

The ability to implement all basic logic functions using only NAND gates demonstrates the gate's versatility and importance in digital circuit design. This property allows for simplified manufacturing processes and reduced costs in integrated circuit production.
