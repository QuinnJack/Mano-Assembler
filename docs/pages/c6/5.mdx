# Subroutines in Assembly Language

Subroutines in assembly language allow the reuse of a set of instructions multiple times within a program, eliminating the need to rewrite the same code. A subroutine is a self-contained sequence of instructions that performs a specific task and can be branched to from any part of the main program. Upon completion, the subroutine must return to the point in the main program from which it was called.

## Subroutine Linkage

To effectively manage subroutines, it's essential to address the return point since multiple calls to the subroutine can originate from different locations within the main program. The Mano machine employs the `BSA` (Branch and Save Return Address) instruction for this purpose. This instruction saves the return address and transfers control to the subroutine.

### Example: Subroutine for Shifting

Consider a subroutine that shifts the contents of the accumulator (AC) four times to the left. This operation is useful for processing binary-coded decimal numbers or alphanumeric characters.

```asm
ORG 100          ; Starting address of the main program
X, HEX 1234      ; Data location X
Y, HEX 4321      ; Data location Y
MSK, HEX FF00    ; Mask for high-order bits

; Main Program
LDA X            ; Load X into AC
BSA SH4          ; Branch to subroutine SH4
STA X            ; Store shifted result back in X
LDA Y            ; Load Y into AC
BSA SH4          ; Branch to subroutine SH4 again
STA Y            ; Store shifted result back in Y
HLT              ; Halt the program

; Subroutine SH4
SH4, HEX 0       ; Save return address here
CIL              ; Circulate left once
CIL              ; Circulate left once more
CIL              ; Circulate left again
CIL              ; Circulate left fourth time
AND MSK          ; Mask to set AC(13-16) to zero
BUN SH4 I        ; Return to main program (indirect address)
END
```
In this example, the BSA instruction saves the return address in the location defined by SH4 and sets the program counter to the next instruction in the subroutine. After executing the subroutine, the BUN SH4 I instruction returns control to the main program using the saved return address.

## Subroutine Parameters and Data Linkage

Subroutines often require parameters from the main program and must return results. In the basic computer, data can be transferred via the accumulator or through specific memory locations.

### Example: Logic OR Operation Subroutine

Let's consider a subroutine that performs a logic OR operation on two operands.


```asm
ORG 200          ; Starting address of the main program
X, HEX 3AF6      ; First operand
Y, HEX 7B95      ; Second operand
TMP, HEX 0       ; Temporary storage

; Main Program
LDA X            ; Load first operand into AC
BSA OR           ; Branch to subroutine OR
HEX 7B95         ; Second operand stored here
STA Y            ; Store result back in Y
HLT              ; Halt the program

; Subroutine OR
OR, HEX 0        ; Save return address here
CMA              ; Complement AC
STA TMP          ; Store complemented value in TMP
LDA OR I         ; Load second operand indirectly
CMA              ; Complement second operand
AND TMP          ; AND with first operand
CMA              ; Complement to get OR result
ISZ OR           ; Increment return address
BUN OR I         ; Return to main program (indirect address)
END
```
In this example, the first operand is loaded into the AC, and the second operand is placed in the location following the BSA instruction. The subroutine performs the OR operation and stores the result.



## Handling Multiple Parameters

For more complex subroutines requiring multiple parameters, additional steps are needed to manage data transfer and return addresses.

### Example: Moving a Block of Data
Consider a subroutine that moves a block of data from one location to another.

```asm
ORG 300          ; Starting address of the main program
; Main Program
BSA MVE          ; Branch to subroutine MVE
HEX 100          ; Source address
HEX 200          ; Destination address
DEC -16          ; Number of items to move
HLT              ; Halt the program

; Subroutine MVE
MVE, HEX 0       ; Save return address here
LDA MVE I        ; Load source address
STA PT1          ; Store in first pointer
ISZ MVE          ; Increment return address
LDA MVE I        ; Load destination address
STA PT2          ; Store in second pointer
ISZ MVE          ; Increment return address
LDA MVE I        ; Load number of items
STA CTR          ; Store in counter
ISZ MVE          ; Increment return address

LOP, LDA PT1 I   ; Load item from source
STA PT2 I        ; Store item in destination
ISZ PT1          ; Increment source pointer
ISZ PT2          ; Increment destination pointer
ISZ CTR          ; Increment counter
BUN LOP          ; Repeat until all items are moved
BUN MVE I        ; Return to main program (indirect address)

PT1, HEX 0       ; First pointer
PT2, HEX 0       ; Second pointer
CTR, HEX 0       ; Counter
END
```

In this example, the subroutine moves a block of data from the source to the destination address, using pointers and a counter to manage the data transfer.

The use of subroutines in assembly language enhances code modularity and reusability, making programs more organized and easier to manage.
