# Miscellaneous Programming in Mano Machine

The program counts the number of 1’s in the number stored in location WRD.
Since WRD = (62C1)16 = (0110 0010 1100 0001)2 number of 1’s is 6; so CTR will have (0006)16

ORG 5       ; Origin of program is location 100

CLE           ; Clear the E register
CLA           ; Clear the accumulator
STA CTR       ; Store the cleared value in CTR (initialize CTR to 0)
LDA WRD       ; Load the word (62C1) into the accumulator
SZA           ; Skip the next instruction if the accumulator is zero
BUN ROT       ; If the accumulator is not zero, branch to ROT
BUN STP       ; If the accumulator is zero, branch to STP

ROT, CIL      ; Rotate the accumulator left
SZE           ; Skip the next instruction if E (the least significant bit of the accumulator) is zero
BUN AGN       ; If E is not zero, branch to AGN
BUN ROT       ; If E is zero, branch back to ROT

AGN, CLE      ; Clear the E register
ISZ CTR       ; Increment CTR and skip the next instruction if the result is zero
SZA           ; Skip the next instruction if the accumulator is zero
BUN ROT       ; If the accumulator is not zero, branch to ROT

STP, HLT      ; Halt the program

CTR, HEX 0    ; Initialize CTR to 0
WRD, HEX 62C1 ; Word to be processed (62C1 in hexadecimal)

, that clears to 0 the con- tents of hexadecimal locations 500 through 5FF.
ORG 5       ; Origin of program is location 100

LDA ADS       ; Load the initial value for the pointer
STA PTR       ; Store it in PTR
LDA NBR       ; Load the initial value for the counter
STA CTR       ; Store it in CTR
CLA           ; Clear the accumulator

LOP, STA PTR I ; Store the accumulator at the address pointed to by PTR (indirect addressing)
ISZ PTR       ; Increment the pointer
ISZ CTR       ; Increment the counter and skip the next instruction if zero
BUN LOP       ; If counter is not zero, repeat the loop
HLT           ; Halt the program

ADS, HEX 500  ; Initial value for the pointer (hexadecimal 500)
PTR, HEX 0    ; Pointer, initially set to 0
NBR, DEC -256 ; Counter, initially set to -256
CTR, HEX 0    ; Counter for loop control, initially set to 0

Write a program to multiply two positive numbers by a repeated addition method. 

ORG 5       ; Origin of program is location 100

LDA A         ; Load multiplier
SZA           ; Skip if accumulator is zero (multiplier is zero)
BUN NZR       ; If multiplier is not zero, go to NZR
HLT           ; Halt if multiplier is zero (product is zero in AC)

NZR, STA CTR  ; Store the multiplier (negative A) in the counter
CLA           ; Clear the accumulator (AC = 0)

LOP, ADD B    ; Add multiplicand to accumulator
ISZ CTR       ; Increment counter, skip next instruction if zero
BUN LOP       ; If counter is not zero, repeat the loop
HLT           ; Halt when counter reaches zero

A, DEC 0      ; Multiplier
B, DEC 0      ; Multiplicand
CTR, HEX 0    ; Counter (initialized to 0)

END           ; End of symbolic program

Write a program for the arithmetic shift-left operation. Branch to OVF if an overflow occurs.
ORG 5       ; Origin of program is location 100

LDA X         ; Load the value from location X into the accumulator
CLE           ; Clear the E register
CIL           ; Perform a circular left shift on the accumulator and E
SZE           ; Skip the next instruction if E is zero
BUN ONE       ; Branch to ONE if E is one (potential overflow)
SPA           ; Skip the next instruction if the accumulator is positive
BUN OVF       ; Branch to OVF if the accumulator is negative (overflow)
BUN EXT       ; Branch to EXT if no overflow

ONE, SNA      ; Skip the next instruction if the accumulator is negative
BUN OVF       ; Branch to OVF if the accumulator is negative (overflow)

EXT, HLT      ; Halt the program

OVF, HLT      ; Halt the program at the overflow label

X, DEC 15     ; Value to be shifted (example value)

END           ; End of symbolic program
