# Input and Output

## Input a character

CIF, SKI          ; Check input flag
BUN CIF           ; Flag is 0, branch to check again
INP               ; Flag is 1, input character
OUT               ; Output the character
STA CHR           ; Store the input character in location CHR
HLT               ; Halt the program

CHR, DEC 0        ; Memory location to store the input character

END               ; End of symbolic program


## Output a character

LDA CHR          ; Load the character from location CHR into the accumulator
COF, SKO         ; Check the output flag
BUN COF          ; Flag is 0, branch to check again
OUT              ; Flag is 1, output the character
HLT              ; Halt the program

CHR, HEX 0057    ; Memory location to store the character to be output (ASCII value for 'W')

END              ; End of symbolic program
