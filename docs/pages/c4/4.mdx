# Shift Microoperations

Shift microoperations are integral to the serial transfer of data within a computer system. They are employed in conjunction with arithmetic, logic, and other data-processing operations. By shifting the contents of a register either to the left or to the right, data can be transferred and manipulated efficiently.

During a shift-left operation, the bits in the register are shifted left, and the rightmost bit receives its new value from the serial input. Conversely, during a shift-right operation, the bits are shifted right, and the leftmost bit is updated from the serial input. The nature of the serial input bit determines the type of shift: logical, circular, or arithmetic.

## Logical Shift

A logical shift transfers a zero through the serial input. The notation `shl` represents a logical shift-left, and `shr` represents a logical shift-right. For example:
- `R1 ← shl R1` specifies a 1-bit logical shift to the left for the content of register `R1`.
- `R2 ← shr R2` specifies a 1-bit logical shift to the right for the content of register `R2`.

In these operations, the register symbol must appear on both sides of the operation. During a logical shift, the bit entering the register through the serial input is always zero.

## Circular Shift

A circular shift, also known as a rotate operation, rotates the bits of a register around both ends without any loss of information. This is achieved by connecting the serial output of the shift register to its serial input. We use `cil` for circular shift-left and `cir` for circular shift-right. The operations can be represented as:
- `R ← cil R` for a circular shift-left.
- `R ← cir R` for a circular shift-right.

## Arithmetic Shift

An arithmetic shift is used for shifting signed binary numbers. An arithmetic shift-left (ashl) multiplies the number by 2, while an arithmetic shift-right (ashr) divides the number by 2. Importantly, the sign bit must remain unchanged to preserve the number's sign.

The leftmost bit in a register (sign bit) remains unaffected during an arithmetic shift:
- `R ← ashl R` represents an arithmetic shift-left.
- `R ← ashr R` represents an arithmetic shift-right.

### Detailed Operation of Arithmetic Shift

Consider a register with `n` bits, where $R_{n-1}$ is the sign bit:
- **Arithmetic Shift-Left (ashl)**: Shifts all bits to the left, inserts a 0 into the least significant bit (LSB) and might result in overflow if the sign bit changes:
$$ R_{n-1}, R_{n-2}, \ldots, R_{1}, R_{0} \leftarrow R_{n-2}, R_{n-3}, \ldots, R_{0}, 0 $$
- **Arithmetic Shift-Right (ashr)**: Shifts all bits to the right, preserving the sign bit:
$$ R_{n-1}, R_{n-2}, \ldots, R_{1}, R_{0} \leftarrow R_{n-1}, R_{n-1}, \ldots, R_{2}, R_{1} $$

If an arithmetic shift-left operation results in a sign bit change (which indicates overflow), an overflow flip-flop (V) is used to detect and handle this overflow:
$$ V = R_{n-1} \oplus R_{n-2} $$

## Hardware Implementation

A shift unit can be implemented using a bidirectional shift register with a parallel load. Data can be loaded into the register in parallel and then shifted either to the left or the right. This setup requires a clock pulse for loading data and another pulse for shifting.

For efficiency, especially in processors with many registers, a combinational circuit for the shift operation is preferred. This approach uses a common bus to transfer data to a combinational shifter, which then shifts the data before loading it back into the register, requiring only one clock pulse.

### Combinational Circuit Shifter

A combinational circuit shifter can be constructed using multiplexers. For example, a 4-bit shifter has four data inputs ($A_0$ through $A_3$) and four data outputs ($H_0$ through $H_3$). It includes two serial inputs for shift-left (IL) and shift-right (IR) operations. The selection input (S) controls the direction of the shift:
- When $S = 0$, data is shifted right.
- When $S = 1$, data is shifted left.

### Function Table of the Shifter

The following table shows the input-output mapping based on the selection input (S):

| S | Output $H_0$ | Output $H_1$ | Output $H_2$ | Output $H_3$ |
|---|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0 | $A_1$        | $A_2$        | $A_3$        | IR           |
| 1 | IL           | $A_0$        | $A_1$        | $A_2$        |

For an $n$-bit shifter, $n$ multiplexers are required. Another multiplexer can control the two serial inputs to provide logical, circular, or arithmetic shifts.
