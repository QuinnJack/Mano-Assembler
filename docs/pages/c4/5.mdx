# Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit

In modern computer systems, individual registers do not directly perform micro-operations. Instead, these systems utilize multiple storage registers connected to a central operational unit known as the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU is a combinational circuit that executes arithmetic and logic operations. This configuration allows for the efficient transfer of data between registers via the ALU within a single clock pulse period.


To perform a micro-operation, the contents of specific registers are placed in the inputs of the ALU. The ALU processes these inputs to perform the desired operation, and the result is then transferred to a destination register. While shift micro-operations can be handled by a separate unit, they are often integrated into the ALU to streamline operations.

## ALU Design

The ALU integrates arithmetic, logic, and shift circuits to create a versatile operational unit. One stage of an arithmetic logic shift unit is illustrated below. The subscript $ i $ designates a typical stage. Inputs $ A_i $ and $ B_i $ are fed into both the arithmetic and logic units.

Inputs $ S_1 $ and $ S_0 $ determine the specific micro-operation to be executed. A 4x1 multiplexer at the output selects between an arithmetic output ($ E_i $) and a logic output ($ H_i $). This selection is controlled by inputs $ S_3 $ and $ S_2 $. The other two data inputs to the multiplexer are $ A_{i-1} $ for the shift-right operation and $ A_{i+1} $ for the shift-left operation. 

It is important to note that this description pertains to a single stage; the complete ALU circuit must be replicated $ n $ times for an $ n $-bit ALU. The output carry $ C_{i+1} $ of a given arithmetic stage must connect to the input carry $ C_i $ of the next stage. The input carry to the first stage is $ C_{\text{in}} $, which provides a selection variable for arithmetic operations.

## Operations of the ALU

The ALU specified here supports eight arithmetic operations, four logic operations, and two shift operations. These operations are selected using the five variables $ S_3, S_2, S_1, S_0 $, and $ C_{\text{in}} $. The input carry $ C_{\text{in}} $ is used exclusively for selecting arithmetic operations.

### Function Table for the Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit

The function table lists the 14 operations supported by the ALU. The first eight are arithmetic operations selected with $ S_3S_2 = 00 $, as detailed below. The next four are logic operations selected with $ S_3S_2 = 01 $. During logic operations, the input carry is irrelevant and is marked with don't-care (x) values. The final two are shift operations, selected with $ S_3S_2 = 10 $ and $ 11 $. The other three selection inputs do not affect the shift operations.
