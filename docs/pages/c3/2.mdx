# Complements in Digital Computers

Complements are essential in digital computers for simplifying subtraction operations and performing logical manipulations. In any base $ r $ system, there are two types of complements: the $ r $'s complement and the $(r-1)$'s complement. These complements play a significant role in computer arithmetic.

## 9's Complement and 1's Complement

### Definition

Given a number $ N $ in base $ r $ with $ n $ digits, the $(r-1)$'s complement of $ N $ is defined as:

$$(r^n - 1) - N$$

For decimal numbers, $ r = 10 $ and $ r-1 = 9 $, so the 9's complement of $ N $ is:

$$10^n - 1 - N$$

Here, $ 10^n $ represents a number that consists of a single 1 followed by $ n $ zeros. For example, with $ n = 4 $, $ 10^4 = 10000 $ and $ 10^4 - 1 = 9999 $. Therefore, the 9's complement of a decimal number is obtained by subtracting each digit from 9.

### Example

- The 9's complement of 5467 is:

  $$9999 - 5467 = 4532$$

- The 9's complement of 12389 is:

  $$99999 - 12389 = 87610$$

### Generalization to Other Bases

For octal (base 8) and hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, the $(r-1)$'s complement is obtained by subtracting each digit from 7 or 15 (F in hexadecimal), respectively.

## 10's Complement and 2's Complement

### Definition

The $ r $'s complement of an $ n $-digit number $ N $ in base $ r $ is defined as:

$$r^n - N \text{ for } N \neq 0$$
$$0 \text{ for } N = 0$$

This can be viewed as adding 1 to the $(r-1)$'s complement:

$$r^n - N = [(r^n - 1) - N] + 1$$

Thus, the 10's complement of the decimal number 2389 is:

$$7610 + 1 = 7611$$

Similarly, the 2's complement of the binary number 1010 is:

$$0101 + 1 = 0110$$

### Alternative Formation

For forming the $ r $'s complement of $ N $, you can leave all the least significant zeros unchanged, subtract the first non-zero least significant digit from $ r $, and then subtract all higher significant digits from $ r-1 $.

### Example

- The 10's complement of 246700 is obtained by leaving the two zeros unchanged, subtracting 7 from 10, and subtracting the other three digits from 9:

  $$753300$$

- The 2's complement of the binary number 11001100 is obtained by leaving the two low-order 0's and the first 1 unchanged, then flipping the other bits:

  $$00110100$$

## Subtraction Using Complements

### General Procedure

To subtract two $ n $-digit unsigned numbers $ M $ and $ N $ in base $ r $:

1. **Add the minuend $ M $ to the $ r $'s complement of the subtrahend $ N $:**
   
   $$M + (r^n - N) = M - N + r^n$$

2. **Discard the end carry $ r^n $:**

   - If $ M \geq N $, the sum will produce an end carry $ r^n $, which is discarded, and the result is $ M - N $.
   
   - If $ M < N $, the sum does not produce an end carry. The result is $ r^n - (N - M) $, which is the $ r $'s complement of $ N - M $. To obtain the answer in a familiar form, take the $ r $'s complement of the sum and place a negative sign in front.

### Example

- **Subtraction with $ M \geq N $:**

  $ 72532 - 13250 $

  - 10's complement of 13250 is 86750.
  
  - Add:

    $$72532 + 86750 = 159282$$

  - Discard the end carry:

    $$159282 - 100000 = 59282$$

- **Subtraction with $ M < N $:**

  $ 13250 - 72532 $

  - 10's complement of 72532 is 27468.
  
  - Add:

    $$13250 + 27468 = 40718$$

  - Result is negative since there is no end carry. The 10's complement of 40718 is 59282:

    $$\text{Answer: } -59282$$

### Binary Subtraction

Using 2's complement for binary subtraction follows the same principles:

- **Example: $ X - Y $ and $ Y - X $**

  - Let $ X = 1010100 $ and $ Y = 1000011 $.

  - 2's complement of $ Y $ is $ 0111101 $.
  
  - Add:

    $$1010100 + 0111101 = 10010001$$

  - Discard the end carry:

    $$0010001 \text{ (No end carry, result is positive)}$$

  - For $ Y - X $:

    - 2's complement of $ X $ is $ 0101100 $.

    - Add:

      $$1000011 + 0101100 = 1101111$$

    - No end carry, result is negative. The 2's complement of 1101111 is 0010001:

      $$\text{Answer: } -0010001$$

## Handling Radix Points

When numbers contain a radix point, temporarily remove it to form the $ r $'s or $(r-1)$'s complement. Restore the radix point in the complemented number at the same relative position. 

## Complement of the Complement

The complement of the complement restores the original number. The $ r $'s complement of $ N $ is $ r^n - N $. The complement of the complement is:

$$r^n - (r^n - N) = N$$

## Subtraction of Unsigned Numbers

The direct method of subtraction using the borrow concept is less efficient in digital hardware compared to using complements. By adding the minuend $ M $ to the $ r $'s complement of the subtrahend $ N $, we can simplify subtraction significantly.

### Procedure Summary

1. Add $ M $ to the $ r $'s complement of $ N $.
2. Discard the end carry if present.
3. If no end carry, the result is the $ r $'s complement of the difference, with a negative sign.

This method is highly efficient and preferred for binary arithmetic in digital systems.
