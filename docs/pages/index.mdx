# Introduction

The [Mano Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mano_machine) is a simplified model of a 16-bit microprocessor architecture commonly used in educational settings to teach the fundamental concepts of computer organization and assembly language programming. It serves as an ideal introductory tool for understanding the internal workings of modern microprocessors, encompassing essential features such as instruction sets, registers, memory organization, and control logic.

This documentation aims to serve as a comprehensive guide to the Mano machine's architecture, instruction set, and operational principles. It is designed to assist learners in mastering the concepts and practical skills required to work with this theoretical computer. 

More specifically, this website was created to alleviate the lack of centralized, modern resources available to students in computer engineering, specifically the Digital Systems and Computer Architecture courses at the University of Ottawa. 

Students in ITI 1100 are recommended to study to the end of the "Data Representation" section. CEG 2136 students should study through the "Programming the Basic Computer" section. CEG 3136 students are expected to complete their studies through the "Central Processing Unit" section, finishing the entire documentation.

# Introduction to the Mano Machine

## Overview

The Mano machine is a theoretical computer described by M. Morris Mano. Designed primarily for educational purposes, it offers a simplified yet comprehensive introduction to computer architecture and assembly language programming. The machine consists of a central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), and an input-output (I/O) bus. Despite its limited instruction set and small address space, the Mano machine provides a practical framework for understanding fundamental computer operations and can serve as a microcontroller in various applications.

Key features of the Mano machine include:
- A 16-bit data bus for internal data transfers.
- A 12-bit address bus capable of addressing 4096 memory locations.
- A single accumulator register for arithmetic and logic operations.
- An 8-bit input/output bus for external communication, equipped with interrupt flags.

While the standard configuration of the Mano machine is limited, it can be expanded to a 32-bit accumulator register and 28-bit addressing using hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL. This flexibility allows for the inclusion of additional instructions and extended functionality, making the Mano machine an excellent tool for learning both basic and advanced concepts in computer engineering.
