# Instruction Types

The Basic Computer architecture employs a structured and efficient approach to instruction handling, 
differentiating between three primary types of instructions: memory-reference, register-reference, and input-output instructions.
Each type is uniquely identified and serves specific atomized purposes within the system.

## Memory Reference 
Memory-reference instructions involve operations that require referencing a memory location.
| I (15) | OP (14) | OP (13) | OP (12) | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

These instructions are identified when the three opcode bits in positions 12 through 14 of the instruction are **not** equal to '111' in binary or '7' in hexadecimal. 
The bit in position 15 is taken as the addressing mode indicator (I). When I=0, the address part of the instruction directly points to the memory location involved.
When I=1, the address part of the instruction refers to a memory location that contains the actual address of the operand.

## Register Reference
These instructions specify operations or tests on the registers in the basic computer, such as the Accumulator (AC) register. 
As such, no operand from memory is needed. 
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

The leftmost four bits are always '0111' in binary or '7' in hexadecimal.
The remaining 12 bits provide the binary equivalent of the operation or test to be executed.

## Input-Output Instructions
These instructions are used for input-output operations or system tests and changes that do not require a reference to memory.
| OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | OP | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Now, the rightmost four bits are always '1111' in binary or 'F' in hexadecimal.
