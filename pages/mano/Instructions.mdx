# Instruction Formatting
An instruction is a binary code that specifies a particular operation to be performed. Each instruction is 16 bits long and is divided into three fields: 
the address mode, the opcode, and the memory address. The single most significant bit is determines if the instruction is is *direct* (0) or *indirect* (1). 
The basic computer contains 4096 or 2^12 words. As such, the memory address field is 12 bits long. 
The remaining 3 bits are taken up by the opcode that specifies the operation to be performed by the instruction.
| Direct/Indirect | Opcode | Opcode | Opcode | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Addressing

### Direct
In direct addressing, the memory address field contains the address of the operand. When you store a value of "10" at memory address 0x0000, directly addressing that memory location would return the operand "10".


### Indirect
In indirect addressing, the memory address field contains the address of the memory location that contains the address of the operand.
 When you store a value of "10" at memory address 0x0000, and then store the address of 0x0000 at memory address 0x0001, indirectly addressing that memory location would return the operand "10".
 ### Use

 Direct addressing, used by setting the most significant bit to 0, is simple and efficient. Indirect addressing, used by setting the most significant bit to 1, adds a layer of indirection and is more complex.
 However, indirect addressing allows for more complex programs to be written in dynamic scenarios. Because the data's address might not be known at run time, indirect addressing is essential for 
 implementing dynamic memory allocation and features such as iterating over a sequence of data.
