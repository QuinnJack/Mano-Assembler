# Instruction Formatting
An instruction is a binary code that specifies a particular operation to be performed. Each instruction is 16 bits long and is divided into three fields: 
the address mode, the opcode, and the memory address. The single most significant bit is determines if the instruction is is *direct* (0) or *indirect* (1). 
The basic computer contains 4096 or 2^12 words. As such, the memory address field is 12 bits long. 
The remaining 3 bits are taken up by the opcode that specifies the operation to be performed by the instruction.
| Direct/Indirect | Opcode | Opcode | Opcode | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address | Address |
