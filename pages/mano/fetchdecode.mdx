# Fetch and Decode
The fetch cycle is the initial phase in executing an instruction in the Basic Computer. Its primary function is to retrieve the instruction that needs to be executed from memory, decode the instruction, and execute it. 

## Fetch

 
<Steps>
### T₀ : AR ← PC
 
The value of the next instruction is stored in the program counter. This value is transfered from the counter to the address register. 
 
### T1 : IR ← M[AR] ,  PC ← PC + 1
 The value inside the address register, or the value of the next instruction, is transfered to the instruction register. Then, the program
 counter is incremented to prepare for the next instruction.

</Steps>
## Decode

<Steps>
### I ← IR[15]
The first bit of the instruction register contains the (in)direct bit.
### OP ← IR[12-14]
The next three bits contain the opcode. The type of opcode is determined by the structure of the binary sequence.
### AR ← IR[0-11]
The rest of the bits contain the address of the instruction. If the addressing mode is indirect, then the instruction AR ← M[AR]
is executed to fetch the value the address is pointing towards.
