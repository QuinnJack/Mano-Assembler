# Interupts and I/O Operations
The Basic Computer employs a simple model for interupts and input/output (I/O) operations,
 central to its interaction with various peripheral devices. 
This model is designed to handle 8-bit character data for both input and output operations.
## Flags

### Interupts
The **IEN** (Interrupt-enable flip-flop) can be set or cleared by specific instructions.
When set, it allows the computer to be interrupted; when cleared, interrupts are disabled.
### I/O
FGI (Input Flag) and FGO (Output Flag) are used to synchronize the timing differences between the I/O device and the computer. These flags indicate the readiness of the I/O devices for data transfer, helping to synchronize operations.

 ## Data Transfer

### Registers
Input Register (INPR): Holds an 8-bit character received from an input device.

Output Register (OUTR): Stores an 8-bit character to be sent to an output device.
### Serial Communication:
Input devices send 8-bit character data serially to the processor.
The processor sends 8-bit character data serially to output devices.
### Data Handling:
Serial information from a keyboard is shifted into the INPR.
Serial information intended for a printer is stored in the OUTR.
### Parallel Communication:
INPR and OUTR communicate serially with the terminal and in parallel with the Accumulator (AC).
