# Introduction




<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸ“”">
Some prerequisite knowledge is necessary, including an understanding of the fundamentals of Boolean algebra, binary and hexadecimal number systems, and the concepts of Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and releated micro-operations. You can review the resources tab to learn more about these topics.

The Mano machine, conceptualized by M. Morris Mano, is a theoretical model used for teaching the fundamentals
 of computer architecture detailed in the book *Computer System Architecture (3 ed.)*.
At its core, the machine is a digital computer that has been simplified as much as possible to 
help beginners to understand the complex workings of a microprocessor at a fundamental level. 

### Registers
Registers are small, fast storage locations directly within the CPU, used to speed up the execution of computer programs by providing quick access to commonly used values. The basic computer has 8 registers and a common bus system between them.
| Register symbol | Number of bits | Register name        | Function                         |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| DR              | 16             | Data register        | Holds memory operand             |
| AR              | 12             | Address register     | Holds address for memory         |
| AC              | 16             | Accumulator          | Processor register               |
| IR              | 16             | Instruction register | Holds instruction code           |
| PC              | 12             | Program counter      | Holds address of instruction     |
| TR              | 16             | Temporary register   | Holds temporary data             |
| INPR            | 8              | Input register       | Holds input character            |
| OUTR            | 8              | Output register      | Holds output character           |
