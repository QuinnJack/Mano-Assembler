The Mano machine, conceptualized by M. Morris Mano, is a theoretical model used for teaching the fundamentals of computer architecture detailed in the book *Computer System Architecture (3 ed.)*.
At its core, the machine is a digital computer that has been simplified as much as possible to help beginners to understand the complex workings of a microprocessor at a fundamental leve. The 16-bit computer 
has 4 registers, 256 words of memory, and a simple instruction set.
